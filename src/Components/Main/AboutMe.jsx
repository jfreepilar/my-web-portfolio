        <p className=''>Hey there! I'm Joeffrey, and I've dedicated the past decade of my career to the vibrant world of hospitality. Last year, I ventured on a new journey as an Online ESL tutor. However, my fascination for technology has always been present. In pursuit of this interest, I made the decision to enroll in a bootcamp alongside my teaching commitments, aiming to transition into the dynamic world of web development while challenging myself along the way.</p>
        <p className=''>Beyond teaching and studying, I find joy and thrill in watching captivating movies and series, as well as various sports. I also enjoy working out and playing basketball with friends. Welcome to my web portfolio, where you'll discover my journey, skills, and diverse interests!</p>
